## Why is it open-source?
Some antivirus software flag this file as a **dangerous DLL** (Dynamic-Link Library). Therefore, we've published it on [GitHub](https://github.com/ArcticFN/Zefron). You can also build it yourself using Visual Studio 2022.

## Building
Instead of Debug select **Release** as Configuration then select **Build -> Build Solution**<br>
